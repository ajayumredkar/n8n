🚀 Upskilling in Workflow Automation with n8n – Practice Project 🚀

I’ve started hands-on practice with n8n to strengthen my skills in workflow automation and AI-driven integrations, and this is one of my recent practice workflows 👇

🧠 What this n8n workflow does (JSON attached):

Automatically fetches World News (BBC RSS) and Tech News (The Verge RSS)

Uses AI (OpenAI model) to summarize the last 24 hours of news

Structures the output into clear sections:

World News

Tech News

Runs daily at 7 AM (or manually on demand)

Sends the AI-generated summary directly to email

📤 Output:
A clean, concise daily AI-powered news summary delivered straight to your inbox — no noise, no scrolling, just what matters.

💡 How this helps in day-to-day life:
✔ Saves time by avoiding multiple news apps and websites
✔ Keeps professionals updated on global events & technology trends
✔ Perfect for busy schedules, morning briefings, or leadership updates
✔ Can be easily extended to Slack, Teams, dashboards, or ticketing tools

🔧 Why I built this:
As a Technical Project Manager, I’m actively upskilling in workflow automation using n8n and learning how AI + automation can:

Improve productivity

Reduce manual effort

Deliver real business value

This is just the beginning — more automation-first use cases coming soon 🚀
